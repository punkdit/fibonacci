\begin{abstract}
Simulating the dynamics of excitations in two-dimensional quantum systems that support 
anyons is intractable in general because it is sufficient for universal quantum computation. 
Here we show that for typical processes of interest for the study of quantum error correction 
in anyon systems, the relevant dynamics can in fact be efficiently simulated classically for a 
wide range of system parameters, even when the underlying anyon model is universal. We 
make use of this fact to demonstrate the success of an error-correction protocol for a 
Fibonacci anyon quantum memory. We numerically simulate a phenomenological model of 
the system and noise processes on lattice sizes of up to $128\times128$ sites, and 
demonstrate an error-correction threshold of around $12.5\%$, a number that is comparable 
to those previously known for abelian and (non-universal) nonabelian anyon models.

Anyonic excitations in two-dimensional quantum systems~\cite{Wilczek1990} offer 
tremendous promise for long-term storage and processing of quantum 
information~\cite{Kitaev2003}. The topological features of quantum systems that support 
such excitations are insensitive to local 
perturbations~\cite{Bravyi2010, *Bravyi2011a, *Michalakis2013}, and the excitations 
themselves can in general be used to perform universal quantum 
computation~\cite{Freedman2002, *Freedman2002b}. 

Quantum error correction is vital to harnessing the computational power of these topologically 
ordered systems. When coupled to a heat bath at any finite temperature, thermal fluctuations 
will create anyons that diffuse and quickly corrupt the stored quantum 
information~\cite{Pastawski2010}. Thus, the passive protection provided by the mass gap 
and low temperature must be augmented by an \emph{active} procedure. 

Almost all of the sizable research effort on active quantum error correction for topological 
systems has focused on the case of abelian anyons~\cite{Terhal2014}. These systems are 
well suited to studying quantum error correction because the dynamics of excitations in 
abelian anyon models can be simulated numerically very efficiently, allowing lattice 
simulations of decoding with over 1 million sites~\cite{Duclos-Cianci2010}. The ability to 
efficiently simulate these systems is a consequence of the limitation that abelian anyons 
cannot be used for universal quantum computation. 

Recent investigations have begun to explore quantum error correction for nonabelian anyon 
models~\cite{Brell2013, Wootton2013, Hutter2014}. These models are particularly interesting 
because braiding and fusion of anyons in these models leads in general to universal quantum 
computation. However, the initial studies have focused on models such as Ising 
anyons~\cite{Brell2013} and the so-called $\Phi$-$\Lambda$ 
model~\cite{Wootton2013, Hutter2014} that, while nonabelian, are not universal, a fact 
that was exploited to enable efficient classical simulation of error correction in these systems. 
The remarkable computational power of universal anyon models becomes a liability when we 
seek to simulate these systems on classical computers. 

Here we consider a full simulation of quantum error correction in a two-dimensional lattice 
system with Fibonacci anyons, a class of nonabelian anyons that are universal for quantum 
computation~\cite{Wang2010b}. Fibonacci anyons are experimentally motivated as the 
expected excitations of the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ fractional quantum Hall 
states~\cite{Slingerland2001}, and can also be realized in several spin 
models~\cite{Levin2005, Kapit2013, Palumbo2014} and composite heterostructures~\cite{Mong2014}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\paragraph{Modelling Fibonacci anyons.}

A physical anyon model is abstractly described by a unitary modular tensor 
category~\cite{Wang2010b}. This object contains the data describing the types of anyonic 
particles, as well as the results of topological operations such as braiding or fusion of these 
anyons. The Fibonacci anyon model consists of only one non-trivial particle type, 
conventionally called $\tau$. Denoting the vacuum by $\mathbb{I}$, we can describe the 
possible fusion outcomes of Fibonacci anyons as $\tau\times\tau=\mathbb{I}+\tau$, i.e.~two 
$\tau$ particles can either fuse to vacuum or to a $\tau$ particle.

We can associate a Hilbert space with the fusion outcomes of a fixed number of $\tau$ 
particles, and for $n$ particles of type $\tau$, the dimension of this space grows 
asymptotically as $\varphi^n$ for $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ the golden ratio. Additionally, 
there is a global degeneracy associated with the topology of the manifold on which the 
anyons reside. We will consider systems with the topology of a torus, which for the Fibonacci 
anyons gives rise an extra 2-fold degeneracy. For convenience (in particular to minimize 
finite-size effects in our numerical computations), this global space is the one in which we will 
encode, and demonstrate protection of, quantum information.
	
The fusion outcome of any particular experiment depends on the history of the particles, in 
particular how they have braided around one another. For this reason braiding operations are 
considered to act unitarily on the fusion space. Pair-creation events should be considered 
isometries that enlarge the fusion space, while fusion events correspond to projective 
measurements of combined charge of some number of particles. For details of the description 
of these processes in Fibonacci anyons, see Ref.~\cite{Trebst2008}. 
\stf{check that this ref is a good one...}

We use a phenomenological model of Fibonacci anyon dynamics which neglects any 
microscopic details of the system. This is consistent with the principles of topologically 
ordered systems and anyonic physics, where the key universal features describing the anyon 
model correspond to large length-scale physics, while the microscopic physics plays a less 
important and non-universal role. As such, we model the system simply as a square lattice of 
sites on which sets of anyons can reside. Allowed anyon dynamics are considered to be local 
on this lattice, which we take to have periodic boundary conditions. For more details of an 
analogous model, see~\cite{Brell2013}.
	
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\paragraph{Noise and error-correction.}

The main noise processes we consider are pair-creation events, in which a pair of $\tau$ anyons are created from vacuum on two neighbouring sites.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%	
\paragraph{Simulation.}

Although simulating pair creation, braiding, and fusion of $n$ Fibonacci anyons is equivalent 
to in computational power to universal quantum computing (and thus unlikely to be classically 
tractable), noise and error-correction procedures have structure that we can exploit to 
efficiently simulate typical processes of interest. In particular, those processes in which we 
expect error-correction to succeed are also those that we expect to be able to efficiently 
simulate for the following heuristic reasons.

Below the (bond) percolation threshold for (say) a square lattice, we expect random sets of 
bonds to decompose into separate clusters of average size $O(\log(n))$ and variance 
$O(1)$,~\cite{Bazant2000}. In our context, the random bonds correspond to noise processes, 
and so disconnected clusters correspond to sets of anyons that could not have interacted at 
any point in their history. As such, we can simulate the braiding processes of each cluster 
separately. In other words: the quantum state factorizes into a tensor product, and we can 
compute with each factor separately. Since each cluster has size only $O(\log(n))$, we can 
typically simulate these dynamics efficiently because the resulting fusion space has 
dimension $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. There are rare random processes that violate this 
reasoning, but processes such as these are suppressed exponentially in $L$, the 
lattice size~\cite{Grimmett1989}. 

However, random noise processes are not the only dynamics that we need to consider. We 
must also consider the effect of the error-correction routine itself. This acts iteratively to fuse 
particles on increasing length scales. While this kind of fusion would typically merge clusters, 
forcing us to compute dynamics of larger and larger sets of anyons, at each length scale the 
total number of anyons present is dramatically reduced. Indeed, the goal of the error 
correction algorithm is to reduce the number of anyons as much as possible.

\cggb{Can we make a concrete claim about the maximum size of clusters at each stage of the 
decoding procedure?} \stf{Well, the worst case behavior has no bound, so we need a 
statement about expectation.} \cggb{Do we know anything about the distribution of 
separations between clusters in the sub-critical percolation regime?} \stf{I think the Bravyi \& 
Haah appendix might provide some results that would be useful in making such a statement.}

Of course, if we were to consider noise so strong that the clusters percolate over the lattice, we would no longer be able to efficiently simulate the system. However, recall that logical errors in our system correspond to processes that act over a non-trivial loop of the torus. If the noise operations are so common to have percolated, this is an example of a situation where we expect error-correction \emph{not} to succeed. Similarly, if the noise has not yet percolated by itself, but the clusters are merged into a large (percolated) cluster by the decoding algorithm, this is again an example of a process that we expect to correspond to a failure of error-correction. So we see that the events that we are able to efficiently simulate correspond precisely to those for which we expect error-correction to succeed. We can simply declare failure on non-simulable events. This allows us to simulate and demonstrate the success of error-correction schemes for Fibonacci anyons, without explicitly simulating the failure of such schemes.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%	
\paragraph{Simulation algorithm.}

We cover the surface of the torus with $L\times L$ disjoint squares. These \emph{tiles} are the regions over which
charge measurements occur, in order to produce a syndrome for the decoder.

In order to keep track of the observables of the system we maintain a set of disjoint \emph{curves}. These curves can also be thought of as a top-down view of the fusion tree. In general, this winds around the two dimensional tiles in a haphazard way determined by the progress of the simulation. For comparison, previous work used a single fixed Z-shaped curve (row-major ordering)~\cite{Brell2013}.

	\includegraphics[width=0.27\columnwidth]{syndrome-2.pdf}
\caption{default}
\label{default}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Each round of simulation proceeds in four steps as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The noise process is modelled by a sequence of pair-creation events distributed as a Poisson process across each edge.
	\item We first join curves that participate in the same tile in order to,
	\item measure the charge on each tile. Any resulting anyon is left somewhere in the tile.
	\item The decoder examines this syndrome and clusters nearby anyons. Each cluster is then measured (fused), and the decoder continues to cluster and fuse on larger scales until there are no more anyons, or a non-trivial operation has occurred. The non-trivial operations are those that involve a path that wraps around the torus. All of these alter the encoded state, and so in this case we abandon the simulation round and declare failure to error correct. This decoding algorithm is based on the clustering ``RG'' algorithm~\cite{Bravyi2011}.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\paragraph{Numerical results.}

We plot the performance of the decoder as a function of error rate for varying lattice sizes. The error rate is parameterized by the Poisson process duration $t_{\mathrm{sim}}$. There is clear evidence of a decoding threshold below
which decoding succeeds with asymptotic certainty as the system size increases. This threshold is at $t_{\mathrm{sim}}\simeq 0.125 \pm 0.003.$
