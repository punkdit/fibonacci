\begin{abstract}
Classically simulating the dynamics of excitations in two-dimensional quantum systems that 
support anyons is likely intractable in general because such dynamics are sufficient for 
universal quantum computation. However, processes of interest for the study of quantum error correction in anyon systems are typically drawn from a restricted class that displays significant structure over a wide range of system parameters.
We exploit this structure to classically simulate, and thereby demonstrate the success of, an error-correction protocol for a quantum memory based on the universal Fibonacci anyon model.  We numerically simulate a phenomenological model of the system and noise processes on lattice sizes of up to 
$128\times128$ sites, and find a lower bound on the error-correction threshold of 
approximately $12.5\%$, which is comparable to those previously known for abelian and 
(non-universal) nonabelian anyon models.

Topologically ordered quantum systems in two dimensions offer tremendous promise for long-term storage and processing of quantum 
information~\cite{Dennis2002} \cggb{a relevant review reference?}. The topological features of such systems are insensitive to local perturbations~\cite{Bravyi2010, Bravyi2011a, Michalakis2013}, and have excitations displaying anyonic statistics~\cite{Wilczek1990}. These anyons can in general be used as quantum memories or to perform universal topological quantum computation~\cite{Kitaev2003, Freedman2002, Nayak2008}.

Quantum error correction is vital to harnessing the computational power of these topologically 
ordered systems. When coupled to a heat bath at any finite temperature, thermal fluctuations 
will create spurious anyons that diffuse and quickly corrupt the stored quantum 
information~\cite{Pastawski2010}. Thus, the passive protection provided by the mass gap 
at low temperature must be augmented by an \emph{active} procedure. 

Almost all of the sizable research effort on active quantum error correction for topological 
systems has focused on the case of abelian anyons~\cite{Terhal2014} \cggb{revise citations here: poulin decoding stuff, what else?}. These systems are 
well suited to studying quantum error correction because the dynamics of excitations in 
abelian anyon models (at the RG fixed point) can be simulated numerically very efficiently, allowing lattice 
simulations of decoding with over 1 million sites~\cite{Duclos-Cianci2010}. Standard algorithms to efficiently simulate these systems rely on the abelian nature of these particles, and in particular the fact that abelian anyons cannot be used for quantum computation. 

Recent investigations have begun to explore quantum error correction for nonabelian anyon 
models~\cite{Brell2013, Wootton2013, Hutter2014}. Nonabelian anyon models are particularly interesting 
because braiding and fusion of these anyons in general allows for the implementation of universal quantum 
computation. However, the initial studies of error-correction in nonabelian anyon systems have focused on specific models, such as the Ising 
anyons~\cite{Brell2013} and the so-called $\Phi$-$\Lambda$ 
model~\cite{Wootton2013, Hutter2014} that, while nonabelian, are not universal. The general dynamics of these particular anyon models is known to be classically simulable, a fact
that was exploited to enable efficient simulation of error correction in these systems. When considering more general anyon models, their ability to perform universal quantum computation would seem a significant barrier to their simulation on a classical computer. While simulation of general dynamics does indeed seem intractable, we argue that the kinds of processes that are typical of thermal noise are sufficiently structured to allow for their classical simulation in precisely the regimes where we expect successful error correction to be possible. This insight allows us to simulate both noise and error-correction for a quantum code based on a universal anyon model.

Here we consider a full simulation of quantum error correction in a two-dimensional lattice 
system with Fibonacci anyons, a class of nonabelian anyons that are universal for quantum 
computation~\cite{Freedman2002, Nayak2008}. Fibonacci anyons are experimentally motivated as the 
expected excitations of the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ fractional quantum Hall 
states~\cite{Slingerland2001}, and can also be realized in several spin 
models~\cite{Levin2005, Kapit2013, Palumbo2014} and composite 
heterostructures~\cite{Mong2014}.

\stf{cite:~\cite{Bonesteel2012}} \cggb{what is this citation for? something about experimentally relevant in engineered systems?}

We use a flexible phenomenological model of dynamics and thermal noise to describe a system with Fibonacci anyon excitations. Within this model, we apply existing general topological error-correction protocols to simulate the successful preservation of quantum information encoded in topological degrees of freedom. Topological quantum computation protocols using nonabelian anyons typically implicitly assume the existence of an error-correction protocol to correct for diffusion or unwanted creation of anyons. Our results are the first explicit demonstration that such a scheme will be successful when applied to a universal topological quantum computer.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\paragraph{Modelling Fibonacci anyons.}

The topological features of a physical anyon model are abstractly described by a unitary 
modular tensor category~\cite{Wang2010b}. This object contains the data describing the 
types of anyonic particles, as well as the results of topological operations such as braiding and 
fusion of these anyons. The Fibonacci anyon model consists of only one non-trivial particle 
type, conventionally labelled $\tau$. Denoting the vacuum by $\mathbb{I}$, we can describe 
the possible fusion outcomes of Fibonacci anyons as $\tau\times\tau=\mathbb{I}+\tau$, 
i.e.~two $\tau$ particles can either fuse to vacuum or to a $\tau$ particle.

Associated with each set of fusion outcomes for a fixed number of $\tau$ particles is a basis 
vector for a Hilbert space, the \emph{fusion} space. For $n$ particles of type $\tau$, the 
dimension of this space grows asymptotically as $\varphi^n$ for $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ 
the golden ratio. Additionally, there is a global degeneracy associated with the topology of the 
manifold on which the anyons reside. We will consider systems with the topology of a torus, 
which for the Fibonacci anyons gives rise to a 2-fold degeneracy. For convenience 
(in particular to minimize finite-size effects in our numerical computations~\cite{Brell2013}), 
this global space is the one in which we will encode, and demonstrate protection of, quantum 
information.

The fusion outcome of any particular experiment depends on the history of the particles, in 
particular how they have braided around one another. Braiding operations are treated as 
unitary actions on the fusion space. Pair-creation events should be considered isometries 
that enlarge the fusion space, while fusion events correspond to projective measurements 
of combined charge of some number of particles. For details of the description of these 
processes in Fibonacci anyons, see e.g.~Ref.~\cite{Nayak2008} and references therein. 
Braiding of Fibonacci anyons and measurements of fusion outcomes is known to be 
sufficient to implement universal quantum computation~\cite{Freedman2002, Nayak2008}.

We use a phenomenological model of Fibonacci anyon dynamics which neglects any 
microscopic details of the system. This is consistent with the principles of topologically 
ordered systems and anyonic physics, where the key universal features describing the 
anyon model correspond to large length-scale physics, while the microscopic physics plays 
a less important (and non-universal) role. As such, we model the system simply as a 
periodic $L\times L$ square lattice $\Lambda$ of sites with upon which sets of anyons can 
reside. Allowed anyon dynamics (pair-creation, braiding, and fusion) are considered to act 
locally on edges of $\Lambda$. For more details of an analogous model, see~\cite{Brell2013}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\paragraph{Noise and error-correction.}

We consider encoding a qubit of quantum information in the global degeneracy associated 
with the topology of the manifold of our system. We imagine an idealized Hamiltonian for this 
system of the form
\begin{align}
	H=-\sum_{i\in \Lambda}\proj{\mathbb{I}}_i\;,\label{e:hamiltonian}
\end{align}
with $\proj{\mathbb{I}}_i$ the projector to charge $\mathbb{I}$ at site $i$, i.e.~the ground 
space of the model has vacuum (or no anyon) at each site. Given the toroidal boundary 
conditions, this space is two-fold degenerate as noted above. We identify this ground space 
as the codespace of our model. Typical realistic noise processes in this kind of system are 
pair-creation, hopping, exchange etc.~of anyons on neighbouring sites of $\Lambda$. It was 
seen in~\cite{Brell2013} that a simplified noise model consisting of pair-creation events only 
is sufficient to capture the qualitative features of an error-correction simulation, and so for convenience we 
will restrict to pair-creation noise processes in the numerical results presented in this study. Such pair-creation events act 
on neighbouring pairs of sites, and so may be associated with an edge of the lattice, chosen 
uniformly at random at each time step of the simulation. The simulation time, and thus the 
error-correction threshold, will be measured in terms of average number of noise processes 
per edge, as opposed to an iid noise probability per edge. The latter measure is not 
appropriate for error processes in nonabelian anyon models, but the two coincide in the limit 
of low error rates in those cases where they are comparable (see Ref.~\cite{Brell2013}).

In order to perform a logical error on our code, a noise process must have support on a 
ribbon running around a homologically nontrivial loop of the lattice. These correspond to 
processes in which anyonic charge is transported around the non-trivial loop before 
annihilating to vacuum.

Our error-correction algorithm is based on a hard-decision renormalization group (RG) 
decoder~\cite{Bravyi2011}. The decoder proceeds by measuring the occupations of 
anyons at each site of the lattice, forming clusters of nearby anyons and fusing the anyons 
within each cluster, before iterating at increasing length scales. It terminates when the lattice 
is free of anyons (i.e.~we have returned to the codespace) or the clustering length scale 
exceeds the total size of the lattice. \cggb{A few more details? What is our length schedule?} 
\cggb{How does our decoder relate to other decoding schemes used in~\cite{Wootton2013,Brell2013,Hutter2014}?} 
Note that, as was found in Ref.~\cite{Brell2013}, we expect that our qualitative results may be reproduced by most alternative families of decoders, such as matching decoders~\cite{?} and soft-decisions 
RG decoders~\cite{?} \cggb{do we?}. The advantage of using a hard-decision RG decoder is 
its simplicity and flexibility, and the fact that its clustering scheme is compatible with the structure in the noise processes that allows us to classically simulate them.

\paragraph{Classical simulability.}

Although simulating pair creation, braiding, and fusion of $n$ Fibonacci anyons is equivalent 
in computational power to universal quantum computing (and thus unlikely to be classically 
tractable), noise processes and error-correction procedures have structure that we can 
exploit to efficiently simulate typical processes of interest. In particular, those 
processes in which we expect error-correction to succeed are also those that we expect to 
be able to efficiently simulate for the following heuristic reasons (we leave a more rigorous analysis of simulability for noise and error correction processes as an open problem).

Below the (bond) percolation threshold for (say) a 2D square lattice, we expect random sets of 
bonds to decompose into separate clusters of average size $O(\log(n))$ and variance 
$O(1)$~\cite{Bazant2000}. \cggb{Do we want to use the word cluster here again or switch? What was our alternative word again?} 
Each noise process in our model is associated with a (randomly distributed) edge, and so 
disconnected clusters correspond to sets of anyons that could not have interacted at any 
point in their history. As such, we can simulate the braiding processes of each cluster 
separately. In other words: the quantum state in the fusion space of all anyons factorizes into 
a tensor product over bond clusters, and we can compute each factor separately. Since each 
cluster has size only $O(\log(n))$, we can typically simulate these dynamics efficiently 
because the resulting fusion space has dimension $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. There are rare 
random processes that violate this reasoning, but processes such as these are suppressed 
exponentially in $L$, the lattice size~\cite{Grimmett1989}. 

However, random noise processes are not the only dynamics that we need to consider. We 
must also consider the effect of the error-correction routine itself. This acts iteratively to fuse 
particles on increasing length scales. While this kind of fusion would typically merge clusters, 
forcing us to compute dynamics of larger and larger sets of anyons, large clusters are sparse 
(and thus unlikely to be merged), and in addition at each length scale the total number of 
anyons present is dramatically reduced by fusion, leading to a smaller number of anyons that 
must be simulated.

Of course, if we were to consider noise so strong that the clusters percolate over the lattice, 
we would no longer be able to efficiently simulate the system. However, recall that logical 
errors in our system correspond to processes that act over a non-trivial loop of the torus. If 
the noise operations are so common to have percolated, this is an example of a situation 
where we expect error-correction \emph{not} to succeed. Similarly, if the noise has not yet 
percolated by itself, but the clusters are merged into a large (percolated) cluster by the 
decoding algorithm, this is again an example of a process that we expect to correspond to a 
failure of error-correction. In this way, we see that the events that we are able to efficiently 
simulate correspond precisely to those for which we expect error-correction to succeed. We 
can simply declare failure on non-simulable events. This allows us to simulate and 
demonstrate the success of error-correction schemes for Fibonacci anyons, without explicitly 
simulating the failure of such schemes.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%	
\paragraph{Simulation algorithm.}

Our concrete simulation proceeds by associating a \emph{tile} with each site of the 
$L\times L$ periodic square lattice. In order to keep track of the observables of the system 
we maintain a set of disjoint curves, representing the history of anyons on the lattice (these 
curves can also be thought of as a top-down view of the fusion tree). 
\stf{this next sentence is currently incorrect.} \cggb{Why?}
The ends of curves 
correspond to leaves of the fusion tree, or anyons. In general, the curves wind around the two 
dimensional tiles in a haphazard way determined by the progress of the simulation. This 
allows a dynamically generated basis for the fusion space that easily allows for tensor 
decomposition into factors corresponding to disjoint clusters. For comparison, previous work 
used a single fixed basis for the fusion space (determined by row-major ordering of 
sites)~\cite{Brell2013}.

Each round of simulation proceeds in four steps as follows (an example is shown 
in \Fref{f:simex}).

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
	\item The noise process is modelled by a sequence of pair-creation events distributed as 
	a Poisson process across each edge. Curves are created crossing the relevant edge 
	and terminating on the neighbouring sites.
	\item We first join curves that participate in the same tile in order to, 
	\cggb{maybe a couple more lines of detail on this and the next point?}
	\item measure the charge on each tile. Any resulting anyon is left somewhere in the tile.
	\item The decoder examines this syndrome and clusters nearby anyons. Each cluster 
	is then measured (fused), and the decoder continues to cluster and fuse on larger 
	scales until there are no more anyons, or a cluster includes a non-trivial loop on the 
	lattice. Since operators with support on such non-trivial clusters will generally perform an 
	undetectable error on the encoded state, in this case we abandon the simulation and 
	declare failure to error correct.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\paragraph{Numerical results.}

We plot the performance of the decoder as a function of error rate for varying lattice sizes in 
\Fref{f:threshold}. The error rate is parameterized by the Poisson process duration 
$t_{\mathrm{sim}}$, representing the expected number of errors per edge over the simulation. 
We find evidence of a decoding threshold below which decoding succeeds with asymptotic 
certainty as the system size increases at $t_{\mathrm{sim}}\simeq 0.125 \pm 0.003$.

\begin{figure}[th!]
\begin{center}

\caption{Decoder failure as a function of simulation time for various lattice sizes, showing 
threshold behavior around at $t_{\mathrm{sim}}\simeq 0.125$.}
\label{f:threshold}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\cggb{Do we need to define $t_{\mathrm{sim}}$ more explicitly?}

\cggb{Comment on the effect of declaring failure on some simulations on this plot. Would 
we expect it to change if we simulated every event completely? If so, how?}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\paragraph{Discussion.}

We have demonstrated classical simulation of successful error correction in a universal anyon 
model. Though we have chosen several properties of our model and simulation in a 
convenient way for simplicity, we think it very unlikely that they will affect the qualitative 
results, similarly to the results of Ref.~\cite{Brell2013}. In particular, although we have 
modelled our logical qubit as encoded in the global topological degrees of freedom of our 
system, we could have encoded it in the fusion space of several preferred $\tau$ anyons. 
This situation would be appropriate to model error-correction routines in a topological 
quantum computation protocol. Additionally, we expect our results to be stable to changes 
in details of the noise model, decoding algorithm, etc.

None of our techniques are restricted to simulation of Fibonacci anyon dynamics, and could 
equally well be used to simulate successful error-correction protocols in an arbitrary anyon 
code.	

\cggb{Comment on applicability of our simulation techniques to non-phenomenological 
models. Is it possible that the same ideas could be useful when there is more microscopic 
detail available, or are they restricted to exactly our phenomenological setup?}

\stf{Is there a possibility of using MPS like Rob Pfeiffer to improve the simulations or 
include interactions?}

\cggb{Do we have much more to say?}
